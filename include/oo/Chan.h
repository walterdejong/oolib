	the channel class
	A channel is a queue of items that is shared between threads.
	Since threads already use a shared memory model, it makes no sense
	to dump large objects into a channel. They are good for communications,
	synchronisation signalling, and you can pass object pointers through
	channels.

	Mind that only the read() and write() methods do proper locking

	You can't close a channel, as there is never a need to, but you can
	call clear() on it to free up the buffer. This does not do locking,
	you have to make sure yourself that no other thread is using the
	channel at that moment. You can't use a channel anymore after it
	has been cleared (the program will segv). However you can grow() it
	and start using it again.
	Anyway, a channel is not like a	file or socket that you should open
	and close all the time.
